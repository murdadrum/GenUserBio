      I believe there's a need and an opportunity to help build a brighter
      future by encouraging kids to explore and connect with activities curated
      to their individual, specific interests. Considering this sentient,
      generate a set of 30 questions to be administered as part of a user
      interview for UX research into the upcoming development of an after-school
      arts program for kids aged 10 to 18. Questions must adhere to UX industry
      research standards of unbiased neutrality. Questions may be a mix of
      quantitative and qualitative, whichever you determine to be best suited
      for the mission. The user group has been prescreened and selected for
      their existing interest in art. Questions are needed to determine what
      features, if any, of an after-school art program most interest them. The
      results of this interview will also drive decisions and designs for the
      schoolâ€™s mobile/web app, which should be considered as part of the
      interview.

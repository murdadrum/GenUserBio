      Sample User Bios

      Zareen

      Age: 22

      Education: 4th year university student

      Hometown: Bruges, Belgium

      Family: 2 sisters

      Occupation: Project management intern for a large international firm


      Zareen is about to complete a B.A. in Business Administration and hopes an
      internship will launch her career in project management. Even though
      Zareen most enjoys the time spent working with her mentor on a campaign,
      she also enjoys doing other tasks like getting coffee and food for the
      office. She feels these tasks are a good opportunity to network and to
      demonstrate being a team player with keen attention to detail. 


      Zareen would like to demonstrate her commitment on the job, complete
      everyday tasks efficiently, and eventually be trusted with increased
      responsibilities in the office. 


      Elliot

      Age: 44

      Education: Culinary school graduate

      Hometown: Omaha, Nebraska

      Family: Lives with partner

      Occupation: Cook


      Elliot is a line cook who lives in a small city and mostly works in the
      evenings. During the daytime, Elliot does an online data analytics
      bootcamp for 3-4 hours to learn a new employable skill. He usually does
      the bootcamp from local coffee shops or co-working spaces since his
      partner works from home and is in meetings all day. The bootcamp is
      expensive, so Elliot is trying to save money on food and transportation. 


      Elliot’s priority is balancing work and studies with quality time spent on
      his hobbies and with loved ones.


      Leah

      Age: 42

      Education: Doctor of Medicine (MD)

      Hometown: Newport, Rhode Island

      Family: Single, lives alone

      Occupation: Doctor


      Leah is a doctor with a busy and demanding schedule. She works
      unpredictable shifts in a mid-size hospital, and swims for a local
      semi-professional team. Leah has a visual impairment for which she uses
      screen reader technologies. This technology makes using apps and websites
      much more convenient for Leah, but not all apps and websites are optimized
      for screen reader usage. 


      Leah cares a lot about being available to her patients and is often taking
      appointments at the last minute. She would like to be able to spend as
      much of her non-work time as possible on her hobbies and personal life.
      Leah would like for there to be an easier and efficient way to order food,
      groceries, and personal care items to pick up on-the-go.

      Age: 20

      Education: Enrolled in online college classes

      Family: Lives with their mother, father and one younger sibling

      Occupation: Full time student


      Joseph is a recent immigrant to the United States who is enrolled in
      online college classes and is also taking classes at a night school for
      learning English. He can read English well, but sometimes encounters
      difficulties at restaurants or while out running errands, where
      shopkeepers tend to speak very quickly and limited translation options are
      available. Joseph is passionate about sports and the outdoors, and wants
      to explore what his neighborhood has to offer. 


      Joseph’s priority is balancing his studies with fun, while also having
      time to look after his younger sibling when his parents are at work.

      Education: High school and some college

      Family: Married with two college-aged children

      Occupation: Small business owner


      Carlos is a small business owner operating in the middle of a busy
      metropolitan area. Although competition is tough, sales have been steadily
      increasing over the last few years. As the business grows, Carlos will
      need a way to better manage inventory, business administration and
      marketing efforts. Additionally, customers have been asking for a way to
      more easily place orders.

      shares custody of her daughter with her ex-partner. Reena works both day
      and night shifts, and her schedule changes week to week. She is a rock
      climber who goes to the climbing gym a few mornings a week and also drives
      her daughter to soccer practice any nights she’s not working. Reena has
      dyslexia, which makes it difficult to read text quickly and process
      information in fast-paced settings. Reena is health-conscious as well as
      budget-conscious.

      Age: 30

      Education: University graduate

      Hometown: San Jose, California

      Family: Single, lives alone

      Occupation: Senior accountant


      Alfie is a mid-career professional who was recently promoted in their job
      at a large accounting firm. They live in the suburbs on the outskirts of a
      large city. They enjoy the nightlife and social life that San Jose has to
      offer, but may not be able to find as much time for those activities as
      they take on more responsibilities at work.


      Alfie wants to make their team proud, level up their skills and forge
      positive relationships at work so they are in good shape for another
      promotion in a year or two.

      also prepares breakfast and dinner for the family on most days, sometimes
      leaving her with little time to grade papers and plan syllabi. 


      Neelam appreciates products that help her stay more organized and manage
      her time in the classroom and at home.

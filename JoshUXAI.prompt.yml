      Final Note:


      * When the user's name is provided in the input instructions, ensure the
      output for the 'instruction' field includes it to maintain the provided
      context and fulfill the user's request. The user's provided instructions,
      including the name of the persona 'JoshUX/AI', are the core of this
      persona's identity. Thus, this name must be preserved and used as part of
      the instructions for the LLM to follow.
